Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Eike Luedeling, and I lead the Horticultural Sciences group in the Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES). In bringing this module to you, I’m supported by a strong team: Anton Milyaev, Christine Schmitz, Cory Whitney, Hannah Jaenicke, Jan Ellenberger, Johannes Kopton, Katja Schiffers, Lars Zimmermann, Marcos Jimenez Martinez, Prajna Kasargodu Anebagilu, Thorsten Kraska, The materials assembled on this website support the lecture on Horticultural Production and Research in the Winter Semester of 2023/2024. The current plan is to offer these lectures ‘in presence’, i.e. we’ll all meet in the lecture hall Auf dem Hügel 6 in Bonn-Endenich. The lecture times are Wednesdays 08:30-10:00 and Thursdays 12:15-13:45 between 11th October 2023 and 1st February 2024. Module content Horticulture is a very broad topic that we can’t cover comprehensively in a single module. Besides, being the MSc students that you are, you’re entitled to a certain level of depth, which we wouldn’t be able to reach if we tried covering everything. So we decided to concentrate on a few topics that we thought you’ll find interesting. This is a mixture of impressions about particular production systems and current topics that are at the forefront of horticultural research and/or public debate. Inverted classroom We’re going to try something new in this class - an inverted classroom format. This basically means that we’re not just going to be talking at you when we’re all in class. Instead, we’ll try to facilitate your learning by engaging in a participatory process that will require you to actually do stuff, rather than just listening to what we have to say. The format of this active session will vary across the different topic, so that this doesn’t get boring. During our participatory sessions, we want you to consolidate what you’ve learned - which of course requires that you’ve already learned something. Much of the subject-matter content will therefore be presented to you in digital format, to be studied before class. We’ll provide some guiding questions to help you with your studies. We’ll also have sessions where we discuss the content of scientific publications. So each week, you’ll be given a reading assignment, which we’ll then talk about in class. You will be facilitating these discussions yourselves, so you may want to think of some leading questions to guide the conversations. Communication You’ll receive most information related to the class via this website. We also invite you to join the Slack workspace for this module. Slack is a platform that facilitates collaboration within teams or organizations that we’ve found very effective for organizing class contents. The invitation to Slack is on eCampus (you’ll need your Uni-ID to log in). Please sign up with your university email address. We’ll share announcements through Slack, and we also encourage you to organize your group work via this platform. You’ll get a brief introduction into Slack in our first session. Grading There’s no exam in this module, but you’ll be required to deliver a few other things: Write and submit short synopses of what you learned in each of the interactive sessions (10%). Write and submit succinct answers to the practice questions (10%). Lead at least two paper discussion sessions and participate actively in discussions led by others (20%). Prepare a term paper on one of the lecture topics (40%). Present the content of your term paper to your peers towards the end of the paper (20%). You’re also expected to come to class prepared and participate actively in the interactive sessions and paper discussions. Lecture topics In each of the 15 weeks of the semester, we’ll cover one topic. After week 1, we’ll have our interactive session every Wednesday (08:30-10:00). On Thursdays, we’ll split into smaller groups to discuss the papers you’ll have read. We’re estimating that this will take us about an hour. The remainder of the time can be (and should be) spent working on and talking about the term papers. We may have some more inputs on academic writing, but this is mainly your chance to get our advice - make sure to use this opportunity! Here’s a tentative schedule for this module (some details may still change): Week 01: Introduction to horticulture Week 02: Temperate fruits Week 03: Global horticulture for SDGs Week 04: Agroforestry - part 1 Week 05: [Berries] Week 06: [From Greenhouse Production to Plant Factories] Week 07: [From Urban Horticulture to Social Gardening] Week 08: [New plants for a future-competent horticultural production] Week 09: Agroforestry - part 2 Week 10: [Safeguarding Plant Health in Horticulture] Week 11: [Climate Change and Horticulture] Week 12: [Robotics and Digitalization] Week 13: [Gender in Horticulture] Week 14: Student presentations Week 15: Student presentations The contents and instructions will be added to this website in the course of the semester. In addition to the lectures, we’re preparing some instruction materials on [Scientific writing], which we’ll make available here too. Introductory materials from week 1 Here’s the introduction to the class. Here you can find some information about the term paper. "],["introhort.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to horticulture 1.1 Term paper topics", " Chapter 1 Introduction to horticulture by Eike Luedeling In week 1, we’re not in inverted classrom mode yet, so this week’s content will consist of an introductory lecture about horticulture. Here are the slides on the introductory lecture on the colorful world of horticulture. 1.1 Term paper topics 1. Horticultural vs. agricultural staple crop research capacity and funding - a comparison Eike Luedeling This term paper compares available research capacity and funding for horticultural crops and staple crop agriculture. This evaluation can focus on a particular geographic context, for which it summarizes the research landscape (universities, other institutes) and funding streams. 2. Horticultural diversity and its regions of origin Eike Luedeling This paper summarizes the evidence on the diversity of horticultural crops that humanity makes use of. It also reviews the literature on the geographic (and possibly cultural) origins of this diversity. "],["temperate-fruits.html", "Chapter 2 Temperate fruits 2.1 Materials 2.2 Instructions 2.3 Literature for discussion 2.4 Term paper topics", " Chapter 2 Temperate fruits by Eike Luedeling, Christine Schmitz, Eduardo Fernandez and Anton Milyaev 2.1 Materials To prepare for class, please watch the following four videos: General concepts (password here) Nuts (password here) Stone fruits (password here) Pome fruits (password here) As supplementary material, we also offer two videos on sweet cherry bloom and apple varieties recorded by our HortiWood team: Apple varieties (password here) Sweet cherry bloom (password here) You need the module password from eCampus to access these files. 2.1.1 Questions In a few lines, describe the main difference between the fruit growing process for pome and stone fruits. Link the process occurring inside the fruit and the changes that farmers could see What are the types of sunburn usually observed in apple orchards? How could farmers avoid this problem? 2.2 Instructions We’ll be going for a walk with you. Depending on weather conditions, the ground may be wet or muddy, and it may be raining/snowing/windy etc. Make sure to dress appropriately! 2.3 Literature for discussion This week we will discuss the following paper: Kofler et al., 2019. High crop load and low temperature delay the onset of bud initiation in apple. Scientific Reports 9, 17986. Read the paper and discuss the tools that are used to study the mechanism of flower bud induction in apple. Why is the understanding of the flower induction mechanism of particular importance for temperate fruit production? Please be critical while reading the work and try to find the confirmation of each key point described in the text with the data that is shown in the paper. 2.4 Term paper topics 3. Apples from a greenhouse: Will it become a common practice? Anton Milyaev Make an extensive literature review to understand how apple production is continuously moving from open fields towards greenhouse production. Why is it happening? Give some examples of best practices for protected cultivation of apples (with main focus on apples from the greenhouse). What greenhouse techniques are already applied in fruit orchards? Try to make a forecast regarding the protected cultivation of apples for the next few decades based on the current trends. 4. Seed dormancy breaking strategies: Do the universal methods exist? Anton Milyaev In this work you will do literature research on effective strategies for breaking seed dormancy, a resting period of seeds during which they fail to germinate. Present your results and describe the best-practice dormancy breaking strategies for seeds – from use of growth regulating compounds to the artificial environments (controlled climatic conditions) that make seeds germinate. Try to find out whether there are universal methods for some plant species or whether these methods strongly depend on the genotype. Or maybe it even depends on the climatic zones that are native for certain plant species that allows using the same dormancy breaking strategies on the plats grown in the same zone? 5. Influences of spring frost protection on the environment Christine Schmitz This term paper selects some frost protection measures and reviews the side effects of their use. It should include effects within in orchard as well as on the environment. 6. Calcium nutrition of apple trees Christine Schmitz This term paper reviews calcium fertilization for apple trees. What is the current state of knowledge in research? What are the challenges and what is the effectiveness of calcium fertilization? It includes a short overview of the importance of calcium in apple trees. 7. Rest breaking strategies in temperate fruit trees Eike Luedeling In many warm growing regions of temperate fruits, trees struggle to accumulate sufficient winter chill to break their dormancy. Climate change appears to be aggrevating this problem. Growers are therefore looking for, and in many cases already applying, strategies to artificially promote dormancy release. This term paper reviews the current state of knowledge on strategies for artificial rest-breaking and discusses the challenges and opportunities.

The agenda provides a blueprint for a sustainable future with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this lecture we will discuss the relationship between these SDGs and global horticultural production. 3.1 Materials The materials for this course will include videos, live lectures, group work and discussions. 3.2 Questions Name a potential synergy between two or more SDGs as they relate to horticultural production. Answer the same question but talk about trade-offs. Name one aspect of the development strategy in your country that is related to the SDGs and horticulture. 3.3 Instructions In our time together in the lecture we will discuss the SGDs and their relationship to horticulture. We will offer some overview and invite you to think critically about the transformations that are needed for horticulture to realistically contribute to the SDGs, and about any associated trade-offs. You will take on the role of an SDG and briefly present yourself and your targets and how they relate to horticulture. We will present you with some scenarios to explore SDGs and horticultural production. We will invite you to work in your groups to build a diagram of the SDGs and horticulture, see Stockholm Resilience Centre You will read up on and prepare for role playing as one of the 17 SDGs. Please review the SDGs and their targets with the UN SDG targets map. Please also review the background and story of the SDGs by The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. 3.4 Literature for discussion We will read a paper by Jaenicke &amp; Virchow (2018). The authors describe the role of horticulture for supporting the SDGs. The contribution of horticulture to sustainable development. 3.5 Term paper topics 8. The contribution of horticulture to the Sustainable Development Goals with a specific focus on SDG 2 Hannah Jaenicke In this term paper you will look into the various contributions horticultural production, processing and consumption make towards achieving the SDGs. You will also take a critical look into possible detrimental developments. 9. The Sustainable Development Goals and German policy on agroforestry Prajna Kasargodu Anebagilu In this term paper you will look into the implications of SDG relevant German policy and how it relates to horticulture, in particular agroforestry production systems. "],["agroforestry.html", "Chapter 4 Agroforestry 4.1 Materials 4.2 Instructions 4.3 Literature for discussion 4.4 Term paper topics", " Chapter 4 Agroforestry by Katja Schiffers, Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez and Cory Whitney Agroforestry refers to a land-use system that integrates trees or shrubs into agricultural land and/or livestock farming. By diversifying production it can generate social, economic and environmental benefits. Agroforestry is also increasingly recognized as one of the most promising land use options for addressing multiple Sustainable Development Goals and confronting the challenges of climate change mitigation, food security, soil degradation, decline of biodiversity and desertification. 4.1 Materials The following three videos will give you a first overview of what agroforestry is, what it can contribute, and what it looks like in practice: 4.1.1 What is agroforestry? Here are the slides that belong to this video. 4.1.2 What does agroforestry contribute? Here are the slides that belong to this video. 4.1.3 Agroforestry examples Here are the slides that belong to this video. 4.1.4 Agroforestry in the European Union Also go through the following briefing document, developed for the European Parliament, which outlines the current situation and legal setting of agroforestry in Europe: Agroforestry in the European Union You can also find this on eCampus. 4.1.5 Questions (or rather “assignments” today) Name the three basic types of agroforestry according to the most commonly used classification system. Name seven reasons why a farmer may benefit from introducing agroforestry on her farm. Briefly describe two examples of agroforestry systems (in up to three sentences each). Name three constraints to the implementation of agroforestry in Europe. 4.2 Instructions This week we’ll take a shot at designing an agroforestry system. You’ll get more detailed instructions in class. 4.3 Literature for discussion We’re discussing the following paper: Tsonkova et al. 2018: Addressing farmer-perceptions and legal constraints to promote agroforestry in Germany. Agroforestry Systems 92, 1091–1103 You can also find it on eCampus. In addition - this is optional - we encourage you to take a look at the following materials: A paper on the perceptions of various stakeholders across Europe towards agroforestry: Garcia de Jalon et al. 2018: How is agroforestry perceived in Europe? An assessment of positive and negative aspects by stakeholders A selection of two chapters of a brand new textbook on agroforestry. This is the long-awaited second edition of the “An Introduction to Agroforestry” - a seminal textbook by PK Nair et al. that was first published in 1991: An Introduction to Agroforestry 4.4 Term paper topics 8. The challenges of agroforestry modeling Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Modeling agroforestry systems are more complex than monocultures, so they have presented considerable challenges to the modeling community. This term paper outlines these challenges and reviews how they have been addressed in previous modeling attempts. 9. Barriers to agroforestry adoption in Germany (or elsewhere) Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Many experts agree that agroforestry systems can offer environmental, economic and social benefits to farmers. Yet adoption rates often remain low due to an array of barriers that keep farmers from integrating trees with other agricultural practices. This term paper reviews these barriers and proposed ideas for overcoming them. 10. Agroforestry in Germany (or elsewhere) - present distribution expansion potential Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Agroforestry has gained traction in many places, yet its spread in Germany (and many other countries) has been slow. This term paper reviews what types of systems exist and where they can be found (possibly using case studies). It also speculates on the potential distribution within this geographic region.
